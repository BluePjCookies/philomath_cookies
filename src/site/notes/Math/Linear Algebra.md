# Linear Algebra (Elementary)
## Vectors

Vectors are usually represented as column of numbers that encode a direction and magnitude.

$$
\vec{v} = 
\begin{pmatrix}
x_1\\
x_2\\
\vdots \\
x_n
\end{pmatrix}
$$

The magnitude of a vector can be determined by summing the square of each term in the column and square rooting the result.

$$
|\vec{v}| = \sqrt{x_1^2 + x_2^2 + \dots + x_n^2} = \sqrt{\sum_{n=1}{x_n^2}}
$$

### Dot Product

The Dot product of two vectors is
$$
A \cdot B = |A||B| \cos \theta
$$

And
$$
A \cdot B = \sum_{n=1} a_nb_n
$$

Look at derivation of the formula [[Math/Derivations/Proof for Dot Product\|here]]

---

### Cross Product
The cross product of two vectors creates another vector that is *perpendicular* to both vectors.
$$
A \times B = |A||B| \sin \theta \ \hat{\mathbf{n}}
$$
Where $\hat{\mathbf{n}}$ is a unit vector perpendicular to A and B. The direction of $\hat{\mathbf{n}}$ can be determined using the right hand grip rule.

Your fingers curl from vector a to b, while your thumb represents the direction of  $a \times b$

Thus
$$
A \times B = - B \times A
$$


The **determinant** trick to finding cross product.
$$
\begin{pmatrix} a_1\\ a_2\\ a_3 \end{pmatrix} \times \begin{pmatrix} b_1\\ b_2\\ b_3 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} a_2b_3-b_2a_3\\ - (a_1b_3-b_1a_3)\\ a_1b_2 - b_1a_2 \end{pmatrix}
$$
1. Cover up the first row
2. Multiply both sides diagonally and subtract it. (First element)
3. Cover up second row
4. Multiply both sides diagonally  and subtract it. Multiply by -1. (Second element)
5. Cover up third row
6. Repeat step 2  (third element)

### Area bounded by Vectors

![Pasted image 20250423155837.png|centre | 300](/img/user/Images/Pasted%20image%2020250423155837.png)

The area of the parallelogram can be deduced. Let $u$ be the base and $h$ be the height. The Area would be $|u|h$.  $h$ can be expressed as.

$$
h = |v|\sin \theta
$$
Thus
$$
|u|h = |u||v| \sin \theta = |u \times v|
$$
Thus the area of the parallelogram can be determined by the magnitude of the cross product of $u$ and $v$.

Sample qn: Prove that the volume of a cuboid is.
$$
\text{Volume of Cuboid} = |a \cdot (b\times c)|
$$

## Points, Lines, Planes
### Point
A point is self-evidently a point in 3d space.

### Lines

Starting from what we know best
$$
y = mx + b
$$
A line in a vector space can be described as
$$
\hat{r} = \hat{a} + t \hat{b}
$$

### Planes

Starting from what we know. The equation of a plane in Cartesian form is
$$
ax + by + cz = D
$$
Using the properties of dot product, it can be rewritten as
$$
\begin{pmatrix}
x \\
y \\ 
z
\end{pmatrix}
\cdot
\begin{pmatrix}
a \\
b \\ 
c
\end{pmatrix}
= D$$
or
$$
r \cdot \hat{n} = D
$$
where $\hat{n}$ is the normal vector of the plane. And $r$ is a vector that lies on the plane
#### Intersection of Planes

Given three planes, if their normal vectors satisfy this criteria then the plane must intersect at a unique point.
$$
n_1 \cdot (n_2 \times n_3) \neq 0
$$

However, if this is satisfied
$$
n_1 \cdot (n_2 \times n_3) = 0
$$
![Pasted image 20250423155647.png|centre| 300](/img/user/Images/Pasted%20image%2020250423155647.png)
You have to find $D$, often by subbing $x = 0$, which determines whether it has infinite solutions or form a triangle (no solutions) shown above

## Matrices
Recall how a function in algebra **transforms** x to y?
$$
f(x) = y
$$
In linear algebra, instead of x and y's which are scalar values, linear algebra **transforms** vectors into another vector.

$$
f  (\vec{x}) = \vec{y}
$$
However, to make the distinction clearer, mathematicians use A instead of f.
$$
A \vec{x} = \vec{b}
$$
---
We need special tools to work with vectors, and this is where matrices comes in. A matrix encodes a transformation on a vector, similar to how a function (f) encodes a transformation of x to y.

eg. 
$$
\begin{pmatrix}
1 & 2 \\
3 & 4
\end{pmatrix}
\hat{x} = \hat{y}
$$ 
where A is a matrix and $A = \begin{pmatrix}1 & 2 \\ 3 & 4 \end{pmatrix}$ 
$$
\begin{pmatrix}
1 & 2 \\
3 & 4
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
x_1 \\ x_2\end{pmatrix}=
\begin{pmatrix}y_1 \\ y_2 \end{pmatrix}
$$
Note that the dim of a vector has to be the same as the number of columns of matrix (A).

### Matrix Multiplication (How does it transform between $\hat{x}$ to $\hat{y}$?)

**Matrix multiplication**
1. Take the nth row of numbers in A
2. Pivot it clockwise by 90 degrees into the mth column in $\hat{x}$
3. Multiply it respectively with the variable associated with it
4. Add up all the numbers in the column
5. The value would be on the nth row and mth column in $\hat{y}$ 

Thus
$$
\begin{pmatrix}
1 & 2\\
3 & 4
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
x_1\\
x_2
\end{pmatrix}
=
\begin{pmatrix}
x_1 + 2x_2\\
3x_1 + 4x_2
\end{pmatrix}
$$
Bravo!! We have transformed $\hat{x}$ into a completely new vector $\hat{y}$ !!

### System of Linear Equations

A matrix also encodes a system of linear equations. Suppose there are 2 equations as shown, and we want to solve for a and b. 
$$
\begin{cases}
a + b = 20\\
2a +b = 23
\end{cases}
$$

A matrix representation of the above is as given

$$
\begin{pmatrix}
1 & 1\\
2 & 1
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
a\\
b
\end{pmatrix}
 =
\begin{pmatrix}
a + b \\
2a + b
\end{pmatrix}
=
\begin{pmatrix}
20\\
23
\end{pmatrix}
$$

look, aren't they equivalent??

Solving for the coefficients are as easy as
$$
\begin{pmatrix}
a\\
b
\end{pmatrix}
 = 
\begin{pmatrix}
1 & 1\\
2 & 1
\end{pmatrix}^{-1} \begin{pmatrix}20 \\ 23 \end{pmatrix}
$$

Where the inverse of the matrix is essentially the reverse of its transformation, similar to how $f:x \mapsto y$ , thus $f^{-1} :y \mapsto x$ . Note, the inverse does not exist if the transformation is not one to one. But for square matrices, there is always an inverse 99% of the time.---

# Linear Algebra (Modern)
## Infinite Vectors and Functional Spaces

> "The only thing limiting us in Math is our imagination" ~ Joshua

Functions are vectors. What? Yes it's true. All functions are an infinite vector and these infinite vectors live within something called a Functional Space. 
### Introduction to Infinite-dimensional vectors functions

Take a function $f(x)$. Suppose we get all values of $f(x)$ from $0 \leq x \leq n$ . And formulate them in a vector.
$$
f(x) = \begin{pmatrix}
f(0) \\
f(0.00\dots 1)\\
\vdots \\
f(n)
\end{pmatrix}
$$
### Orthogonal Basis
Suppose $f(x) = \sin x$. Since  $\sin$ is an oscillatory function, the domain of $x$ that we are interested in is thus $x \in \{\mathbb{R}| 0 \leq x \leq 2\pi \}$Â 

Recall that in Euclidean space, a linear combination of two orthogonal (perpendicular) vectors, $\hat{i}$ and $\hat{j}$  can describe any point on the plane? Similarly, to describe any point/functions within this Functional space, we want to find orthogonal vectors or functions.

Thus we need to find two functions where its dot product is 0.
$$
\hat{f}(x) \cdot \hat{g}(x) = 0
$$
When dealing with finite vectors, the dot product is defined as [[Math/Linear Algebra#Dot Product\|such]], where each element in the vector is multiplied and summed together.

$$
\hat{A} \cdot \hat{B} = \sum_{n=1} a_nb_n
$$
Similarly, in the context of infinite vectors, it is defined as 
$$
\hat{f}(x) \cdot \hat{g}(x) = \int f(x)\ g(x) \ dx
$$
Fourier discovered that the two functions $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are $\sin x$ and $\cos x$ respectively. As
$$
\int_0^{2\pi} \sin x \cos x \ dx  = 0
$$
Thus, $\sin$ and $\cos$ act as orthogonal basis vectors in Functional space. Proving that every single function can be expressed as a linear combination of $\sin$ and $\cos$ waves.
