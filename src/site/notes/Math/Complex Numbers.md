An imaginary is defined as $i$ with the following property

$$
i^2 = -1
$$
It corresponds to a $\frac{\pi}{2} rad$ anti-clockwise rotation and can also be expressed as a matrix

$$
i = \begin{pmatrix}
0 & -1\\
1 & \ 0
\end{pmatrix}
$$
such that
$$
i^2 = \begin{pmatrix}
0 & -1\\
1 & 0
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
0 & -1\\
1 & 0
\end{pmatrix} = 
\begin{pmatrix}
-1 & 0\\
0 & -1
\end{pmatrix} = -1
$$
