Similar to Complex numbers, dual numbers can be expressed as
$$
a + b\epsilon 
$$

where
$$
\epsilon^2 = 0
$$
and
$$
\epsilon \neq 0
$$

$\epsilon$ is an infinitesimal value such that its square equates to $\epsilon$. but its value is not zero. This is because a small number say $0.0001$ when squared, gives an even smaller number $0.00000001$. Thus a small number $\epsilon$ when squared, gives $0$.

Using maclaurin series for $e^x$ and Galilean trigo functions.
$$
e^{\epsilon \ x} = 1 + \epsilon x = \text{cosg}x + \epsilon \text{ sing}x
$$
