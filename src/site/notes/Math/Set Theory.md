# Introduction
# Notation
Let $S$ and $T$ be two sets

$$
S = \{ \text{Notation for elements in S}| \text{Properties which specifies being in S}\}
$$
The vertical bar should be read as "such that"
## Complementary Set
If $S \in T$, then $T \setminus S := \{ x \in T | x \notin S\}$ is called the compliment of $S$ in $T$.

## Cartesian Product

$S \times T = \{ (a,b) | a \in S, b \in T\}$ is the cartesian product of $S$ and $T$.
